[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Exploring Academic Assessment Results of New York School Districts Soheil Fakhrieh Kashan / Wangtao Zheng 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction In this project we are exploring New York state academic assessment results for Mathematics and Reading / Language Art from 2015-16 to 2020-21 school years. We are interested in analyzing how student groups from different racial, ethnic, socioeconomic status, students who identify as female or male, and background have performed in state-wide assessment tests. Although this work is purely exploratory and we are not suggesting any causality, the difference in performance can shed light on the current state of academic equity in the state. By law states are required to provide reporting on the state-wide education assessment results to the Department of Education. The assessments are mandatory for grades third through eighth and at least once in high school. The results are reported as the percentage of students who are proficient in two subjects: Mathematics and Reading / Language Art. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic This project explores the 2018/2019 academic achievement results for school districts of New York State. The main focus of this project is to visualize data, highlight strong correlations, and provide rankings based on different measures. We do not go beyond the boundaries of exploratory analysis. The academic assessment results are divided into two categories: results for State Assessment in Mathematics and results for State Assessment in Reading/Language Art. We explore the distribution of the assessment results across these measures: School district Racial and Ethnic Groups Sex Disability Status Economically Disadvantaged Status Migrant Status Homeless Enrolled Status Foster Care Status Military Connected Student Status We also provide a consolidated scoring to combine the Mathematics and Reading/Language Art. This is mainly a means to compare district performance holistically. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a set of visualizations to provide the reader a view on how well different school districts of New York are performing across different subgroups of students. 2.2 Data availability Data Source: As part of the EDFact initiative of U.S. Department of Education data on the academic assessment is being collected and centralized across states and schools. This data is meant to be a high quality and vetted data source that is being used for policymaking and education planning.

It is being renewed/updated annually in each school year; the dataset includes academic performance data ranging from school year 2009-2010 to school year 2018-2019. For this project we will be focusing on The state of New York for the past 3 years. Data Transformation / Ingestion: The data is reported on two different levels of aggregations: LEA level (local education authority) and School level. We are mostly interested in LEA level data for this analysis. There are also two different formats for the latest data: Wide (each value of a subgroup is a field), Long (each value of a subgroup has its own record). The wide format of the data is more suitable for our work but requires transformation. There are 262 variables on the wide version. We need to create new variables such as Race, Sex, Socio-ecomomic status, etc. to summairze the data properly. The data is needed to be consolidated across different years and different assessment types (Mathematics, Reading/Language Arts). All files are provided in csv format. We download the data and export it to the RStudio locally.

It is being renewed/updated annually in each school year; the dataset includes academic performance data ranging from school year 2009-2010 to school year 2020-2021. At the time that we wrote our proposal the data for the 2020-21 school year was not available, but this data became available recently. We have incorporated this data in our analysis as well. Due to COIVID the Department of Education has waived the reporting requirements for the 2019-20 school year. There isn’t any data available for this year. Also, for the 2020-21 school year the participation rate is varied and we have many school districts with missing data. This pattern is explored in our result section. For this project we will be focusing on The state of New York for the past 5 years.

We are mostly interested in LEA level data for this analysis. Mathematics State Assessments results and Reading/Language Arts are also se into two files. There are two different formats for the latest data: Wide (each value of a subgroup is a field), Long (each value of a subgroup has its own record). Throughout the years there are some inconsistencies We have spent a considerable amount of our time transforming and preparing the data for visualization. We will explain some of the challenges we face here. The data is reported on two different levels of aggregations: LEA level (local education authority) and School level. We are mostly interested in LEA level data for this analysis. Mathematics State Assessments results and Reading/Language Arts are also separated into two files. We have filtered the data to include only the state of New York. There are two different formats for the latest data: Wide (each value of a subgroup is a field), Long (each value of a subgroup has its own record). Throughout the years there are some inconsistencies in the data formats. Some years the data is only reported in wide format and some years only in long format. The wide format usually contains 260+ variables. The variables are the combination of categories (race, gender, special status, etc.), school year, grade, and the metric. After exploring different options we have decided to transform all of the wide data to the long format. Another challenge with our data was the grouping and masking of the “Percentage of Proficient” metric. Due to privacy reasons to protect the identities of students. The Percent Proficient is reported as “PS” if the number of students is less than 5. If the number of students are between 6 and 15 the Percent Proficient is only reporting more than or less than 50%. For some of our analysis we have removed these rows but kept the data for demographic analysis of the data. For reporting groups with students less than 300, the data is reported in ranges. We have used the mean of the range to calculate the Percent Proficient. Category variable in our data contains all student types descriptors (race, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status). We have appended a category description and a category type to help us map the data easier. One of the biggest drawbacks in the data is that due to the reporting method for categories, we cannot perform analysis on the cross section of different categories. For example, we cannot analyze the relationship between socioeconomic and race and the impact of that on education assessment results. After the transformations we have a data set with 10 variables and 883K rows. SCHOOL_YEAR: reporting school year DISTRICT: NY school district name SUBJECT: MTH for mathematics and RLA for reading / language arts GRADE: school grades including HS for high school CATEGORY: abbreviated student category includes race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex, etc. CATEGORY_DESC: student category description CATEGORY_TPYE: category type includes race/ethinicity, sex, special status NUMVALID: number of students PCTPROF: percentage of students proficient in the assessment reported in the data with ranges and masked data PASSED: transformed percentage of students proficient converted to numeric Link to the 2020-21 documentation: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/assessments-sy2020-21-public-file-documentation.docx 3.3 Missing value analysis As discussed in the previous part, if the student numbers are less than 5 in a category / grade for a district, the Percent Proficient numbers are masked to protect the students identity. Although this is not null values in the data we cannot perform any analysis at the performance level. In this graph we are exploring what student category is impacted most by the suppression of data. We can see that students with two or more races (MTR) are impacted the most by the masking of the data. There are more that 50k students in total that their proficiency results are not available over the 5 year school period that we have done our analysis. This graph can also indicate student bodies that are the most sparsely distributed among all districts / categories. While we might not be able to fully analyze the impact of the masked data on the performance results we have highlighted this missing data here. As a result of the data structure and the transformations outlined before null values were generated for the PASSED variable (numeric value of Percent Proficient). If the Percent Proficient is marked as PS we have a null value for PASSED. If in the wide format a Percent Proficient is not reported for a grade or category we will also have a null value. We have also observed that there are very small school districts with only high school grades and all other grades are missing. It appears that some districts might not offer all grades but the data is reported as missing for these districts. Further discussion with subject matter experts needed to clarify school district boundaries and reporting requirements to fully understand the missing data patterns. Here we have used the VIM package to visualize the missing data pattern. If NUMVLAID (student number) is missing we always have missing values for PASSED (32% of data). The scenario when we have missing data for PASSED but the NUMVALID is not missing is due to the transformation of PS (suppressed data for privacy protection). We have converted PS to null values so we can have a numeric value for the PASSED variable (this is about 19% of data). "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Student Demographics 4.2 School District Size 4.3 Proficiency Results", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Student Demographics In this section we will explore the reported demographics and population distribution of NY students. We look for any anomalies, highlight trends and point out any consideration we might need to have before moving forward to review proficiency results. why is there a drop in 2020-21 student count? The number of reported students for both Math and RLA assessments are relatively steady year over year from 2015-16 to 2018-19 school years, but we observe a sharp drop in 2020-21 school year. Also, we can observe that the data was not reported for the 2020-21 school year. Upon investigating the Department of Education, we have noticed that the reporting requirements were waived for 2020 and were relaxed for 2021 reporting due to the circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic. This is an important consideration when we analyze the latest school year. This is outlined on the US Department of Education website: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/index.html Is 2020-21 school year data underreported for all grades? We can observe from the chart that in the 2020-21 school year the high school reported numbers are aligned with previous years but the third through eighth grade were significantly underreported compared to the previous years. The reason for this is not totally clear to us but one interesting fact that we will review in the next section is that generally high schools have better ratios of proficiency assessment results. One theory could be that since the results are better the districts have reported these numbers more compared to the other grades. Another interesting demographic observation is that there are almost always less students in seventh and eighth grades compared to other grades. This is another observation that needs to be discussed with a subject matter expert on this topic. What is the distribution of students with reported special status? We can observe that almost 65% of the students with special status are from Economically disadvantaged categories. We cannot directly compute what percentage of the whole population of students fall into this category. It’s also not clear if there is any overlap in categories. It’s notable to mention that less than 0.3% of students with special status fall into Foster care, Migrant, or with Military connected status. What is the distribution of students by who they identified (female / male)? As expected the distribution is pretty even with slightly more students who identified as male with 52% and 48% who identified as female. What is the distribution of students by race / ethnicity? A notable observation is that NY state has a significantly higher ratio of non-white students compared to US national averages. Per government census around 76% of the US population is white while in NY the ratio of white students is 43%. Source: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221 4.2 School District Size What is the distribution of school district size (number of students)? We can observe that the distribution is skewed positively. Majority of the districts have less than 500 students. From looking into the dataset we can easily observe that many of the districts are located in rural and sparse suburbs while districts with higher than 10K are mostly located in NYC and other bigger cities in the state of New York. To observe the difference in the distribution we have divided our histogram into two separate graphs to see the distribution with more than 3K and less than 3K students. Is there any notable difference in the district size by grade? While there isn’t a significant variation in median of district sizes for different grade we see an outlier for High School school districts. This outlier is “NEW YORK CITY GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICT 2”, with more than 7K high school students. 4.3 Proficiency Results What is the percentage of students proficient in Math / RLA? The ridgeline graphs suggest that the proficiency percentage in general is relatively stable over the years. There is a concentration of observations around 50% but there are signs of potential bi-modality especially for RLA around 90% over the years. To further investigate this we have also created a ridgeline of proficiency by grades. We can observe from the graph that the performance in High School is significantly better than other grades. The underlying reason for this is unclear for us and requires some input from subject matter experts. CATEGORY CATEGORY_DESC CWD Children with disabilities ECD Economically disadvantaged F Female FCS Foster Care Status HOM Homeless Enrolled LEP English Learner M Male MAM American Indian/Alaska Native MAS Asian/Pacific Islander MBL Black MHI Hispanic MIG Migrant MIL Military Connected Student Status MTR Two or More Races MWH White How do students from different status, sex, and background performed in the tests? The proficiency results based on identified sex suggests that the perfromance of students who identified as female is overall better than male students across all grades and subjects. The difference in Math is relatively smaller but in RLA there is a bigger gap. As observed in the previous part the high school performance is also better than other grades for both female and male students. The proficiency grouped by race and ethnicity suggests a gap among groups. Asian / Pacific Islander students’ proficiency percent is higher than other groups. The median for White, multiracial and Asian / Pacific is higher than 50% but the rest of the groups lower than 50% meaning that lower than 50% of students were proficient in the assessments. It’s notable to mention that the top 10% of all groups performed relatively the same but the median among different groups are very different. This might suggest an interaction between background and other factors such as higher socioeconomic status. We don’t have the relevant data points to explore this but this is an interesting topic to be explored in the future works. There is a large gap in the median proficiency percent when it comes to groups with special status. The groups reported here are not really comparable by nature. The main takeaway from the exploration is that students with LEP (English Learner), CWD (Children with Disability), and HOM (Homeless) status have relatively lower proficiency rates (all less than 30% median) and could potentially benefit the most from more resources. What are the top school districts in the state of NY? We have used Cleveland dot plots to visualize the top school districts in the state of NY. Since the districts with very high proficiency percentages seem to be all concentrated on the smaller districts we have decided to divide the chart to districts with higher than 3k students and schools with lower than 3k students. There are many districts with lower than 3k students with above 90% proficiency rate. The data suggests that many of these schools are Charter schools and the RLA and Math performance are both very high. The schools with more than 3k students in general have a lower proficiency rate in both Math and RLA. These charts suggest that there is a big gap in performance among different school districts and it seems to be correlated with school district size. Are Mathematics and Reading / Language Art assessment results correlated? Looking at the scatterplot of the two assessments we can observe that the results seem to be correlated. The school districts with better Math proficiency ratios usually have better RLA proficiency ratios as well.
